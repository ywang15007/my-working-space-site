Weber's article, "What shapes perceptions of climate change?", presents reasons for why people may disagree about climate change. Its [main] breakthrough research question is how humans' perception of global phenomena (such as, climate change) affect the environmental problems and potential solution. Specifically, instead of approaching "the perception problem" strategically and politically, Weber takes the psychological, sociological, and cultural approaches to it. 

She distinguishes climate from weather, arguing that weather is easily detected by personal experience whereas climate is not easily detected by personal experience; instead, we often falsely predicate the climate because of our tendency to clung to personal expectations. Therefore, in order to increase our concern about climate change, Webster suggests that we should to learn think more statistically instead of solely emotionally. 

One way to better understand this distinction between climate and weather is through Webster's emphasis of the difference between associative processing and analytic processing. According to her, knowledge of climate can be only gained from analytic processing (like interpreting numeric or graphic data) while knowledge of weather can be obtained from personal experience - i.e., through the processing of associative (and often affective) thinking.      

But, strictly speaking，it is not propitiate (albeit, useful) to distinguish "learning from personal experience" from "learning from statistical descriptions", because *reading* "a statistical description of possible outcome and their likelihood" in the end belongs to the category of "personal experience" - although many people are not (naturally) trained to do *that*. 

To state this in another way, many of the fast and automatic associative processes are developed from the slow analytic ones. That being said, reading statistical description can become a fast and automatic process with sufficient amount of practices. On the other hand, if you want to make deep associations between stuff, learning from repeated personal experience should also be a slow and critical process rather than a fast and automatic one. 

This problematic differentiation between "learning [weather] from personal experience" (i.e., fast associative processes)" and "learning [climate (change)] from statistical descriptions" (i.e., slow analytic processes) becomes easy to understand when the author finally explicates, 

	"The two types of processes [namely, the associative and the analytic] tend to operate in parallel [that is, what Kant may term, 'synthetically'] and also interact with one another [that is, in Kant's lexicon, "analytically"]" (Webster, 2010; words in square brackets are added by me). 

In the other words, they both contribute to the perception of climate change.  

If now you ask me the question of where is the place of philosophy in climate change research, then my answer would be that philosophy operates *amid* these two kinds of learning processes in the two ways just suggested above (in spite of the fact that it seems to fall more into the analytic-processing category). 

Further, in the book *Global Warming: Understanding the forecast*, the author David Archer also differentiates the concept of weather from the concept of climate. However, "weather" in Archer's book is not merely emphasized as a lay concept (constructed by repeated personal observations) but more as a scientific concept (gathered by scientists for estimating the conditions of the earth climate). In Archer's words, 

	"By climate, we mean some sort of an average of the weather, say averaged over 10 years, more or less. [...] Weather is chaotic, but by taking the average, we arrive at something that is not chaotic, which seems to be in some ways predictable."  

That is to say, Weber considers climate as "the statistical expectation" while weather as "what we get" (2010). By this, she highlights that climate is the means to an end while weather is the end. But Archer reverses this relationship. He claims that the measurement of weather would actually help people in estimating the condition of the climate. 

I guess that if treating weather as the means helps scientists to get a quite clear estimate of the earth climate (which is "a statistical phenomenon" after all), then - due to the *feedback* mechanism - treating weather as the end can, in a way, enables us to further test the resulting statistical prediction - the one that we would get from averaging weather conditions.    

In addition to those, Webster also points out in her article that both affect-based and analysis-based decisions do not motivate sustainable, right actions to mitigate climate change well; only those responsibility-driven decisions do. 

Firstly, affect-based decisions motivate people to react immediately and rapidly but they often lead to bad consequences. 

Secondly, according to the classical principle of reinforcement learning, people gives distant events (e.g., risks predicted by climate models) less weight than recent climate events (e.g., extreme weather, flooding, droughts, etc). Namely, distant events, in general, seems to influence individuals' decisions less than the immediate ones. Thus, analysis-based decisions delays people's immediate actions. 

Responsibility-driven decisions, on the other hands, would lead to brighter outcomes (believed by the author), because these decisions prune the undesirable side-effects of both the affect-based and the analysis-based processing of environmental decisions.
