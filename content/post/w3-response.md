**My Writing**: 

Victor, Geels and Sharpe introduces the concept of "system transitions" in their report, “Accelerating the Low Carbon Transition” (2019). According to them, system transitions are typically constituted of three specific transition phases: emergence, diffusion, and reconfiguration. 

Pioneers, such as researchers, entrepreneurs and activists, play a relatively significant role in the emergence phase. They develop niche-innovations that are preserved from mainstream market and system-level application in this phase of transition (Sharpe et al. 21). [*Examples of those innovations include vaccines for COVID-19 and the technological and scientific solutions for mitigating climate change*.] Challenges for policy in this phase include the difficulty in selecting promising innovations for implementation and "providing reliable support for niches even when performance is unknown" (21).

Economic performance becomes one of the important factors for evaluating the capacity and competence of niche-innovations in the diffusion phase (Sharpe et al. 24). One not only needs to consider the functionality of a new object (e.g., of a proposed solution to the global phenomenon of climate change), but one also has to evaluate the competitiveness and social acceptability of that object (namely, of that specific solution to mitigate climate change). In addition, for radical innovations to be widely-spread in the diffusion phase of transition, their technical performance has to be significantly improved, their costs need to be reduced, their embodied "action possibility" must meet the societal needs and people in the society must (at the same time) become capable of perceiving the "action possibility" of those innovations (17). Moreover, Figure 5 in the original report depicts the feedback loop in the diffusion of innovations, which enables us to obtain a more detailed understanding of this second transition phase.  
 
Last but not least, new equilibrium has to be reached in order for a system transition to be completed in the reconfiguration phase. Specifically, new daily practices generated by the application of radical innovations to the society might elicit novel interests, roles and responsibilities from the people.  This further motivates and conditions the actions of these people and reinforces not only this new system but also other relevant systems.    

As one can see, each of these three phases has its own feedback loop that may accelerate the transition processes. For example, in the emergence phase, if more support is provided for a certain innovation, then that type of innovation might become more promising in the end. Given that, I argue that in order to create a positive environment that helps enhance basic scientific research, it is necessary to emphasize the epistemological value of policies - especially when these policies are not likely to be "cost-effective" [immediately] but likely to "yield knowledge about measures to respond to [problems like] climate change".  

> That is to say, one should "*[provide] reliable support for niches even when performance is unknown*."  

In particular, this new knowledge [*created by policy implementation*] can be used not merely to better understand the current situation but also to better educate the public by increasing their ability to perceive the "action possibility" of certain new solutions. And, if these policies are beneficial to people in the long-term term, then it makes more sense to preserve them (than to discard them) even though they seem not to be cost-effective. In this case, emphasizing the epistemological value of these policies reinforces their places in people's daily life. 

Furthermore, in response to the claim that "[the emphasis of the epistemological value of policies] would be a dangerous diversion of resources," I argue that while this group of policies are currently functioning more as a critical education and research mediator, other policies can be enacted to take care of the negative effects (of new technologies and solutions as well as of climate change, etc) on jobs, employees and institutions who have a tendency to resist the transitions caused by the former kind of policies.   

As Victor, Geels and Sharpe have pointed out in their report,
 
> "Well targeted government policy can lessen such resistance by engaging with workers, their unions and communities, and supporting them through the transition" (28).

In short, I think that it is indispensable to offer more support for basic research while striving for a new equilibrium that benefit the climate and people - for the purpose of accelerating the actual transition processes.
