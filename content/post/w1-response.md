Since 1750, methane (CH₄) emissions have made up about 1/4 of the greenhouse gas emissions. Given the urge of demystifying climate stabilization, the Jackson *et al* (2020) article reviews new estimates of the sources and sinks of methane in the global context in 2017, "the most recent year data are fully available," through a comparison of these estimates with the old ones from the period of 2000-2006 in which atmospheric CH₄ concentrations are relatively stable. The methods and data used in Jackson *et al* are the same as the ones used in Saunois *et al* (2020). Namely, they take a top-down (TD) approach accompanied by a bottom-up (BU) approach. Whereas the TD accounting method shows that the estimated changes in CH₄ emissions would rise when OH increases in the atmosphere (and vice versa), the BU approach supplies a more comprehensive picture of the sources of CH₄.  

According to the study, the global undergoes a 9% increase in the value of average estimated CH₄ emissions over the period from 2000-2006 to 2017 - that is, numerically, from 546 Tg CH₄ yr−1 to 596 Tg CH₄ yr−1. More importantly, most of this increase in total global emissions is attributed to CH₄ released from anthropogenic sources. While agriculture and waste contributed 60% of these anthropogenic emissions, fossil fuels contributed the rest 40% of them. Latitudinally, this increase is composed mainly of CH₄ emissions from tropical and temperate regions. In addition to those, the study also briefly mentions that the value of the estimated mean global CH₄ sink (in both the atmosphere and soil) for 2017 (571 Tg CH₄ yr−1) is 5% higher than the value for 2000-2006 (546 Tg CH₄ yr−1).  

Moreover, when it comes to the discussion of natural CH₄ sources, Jackson *et al* (2020) show us that it is relatively easy to observe that "natural sources remain more poorly constrained than anthropogenic ones" but it is hard to actually examine the uncertainty involved in the CH₄ studies for providing more accurate estimates of CH₄ emissions from natural sources. By analyzing the uncertainty through comparisons between existing research outcomes, Jackson *et al*, nevertheless, unfold the complexity involved in scientific inquiry of the global methane budget. 

Specifically, they point out that there are two major sources of uncertainty in calculating global CH₄ emissions from natural sources. These are the amount of CH₄ released from wetlands and freshwater systems and the amount of CH₄ released from natural geological sources (e.g., thermogenic/ancient methane from the Arctic). The former uncertainty is mainly a result of the unclear boundaries set for vegetated wetlands in previous studies. These studies include 'inland waters' within the definition of 'wetlands', which causes 'double counting' of the two. The current study (Jackson et al., 2020) alleviates the effect of this double counting by its deployment of the Wetland Area Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M) dataset. It concludes that vegetated wetlands contributed 101–179 Tg CH₄ yr−1 of the total, whereas the estimated CH₄ emissions from inland waters were higher than those shown in the 2016 study of Saunois *et al* in which the double-counting effect is not mitigated. 

In contrast, the conditions or factors that lead to the later uncertainty are more complex; they are harder to generalize than those that result in the former. However, one thing is clear: the CH₄ emissions from natural geological sources estimated by different studies contradict one another. In other words, for better understanding the contribution/role of natural geology in CH₄ emissions, "[r]esearch is needed to constrain geologic sources fully," as the authors of the current study point out (p.6). Overall, according to the existing research, the estimates of global *natural* CH₄ emissions remain relative unchanged from 2000-2006 to 2017 (Jackson et al., 2020).

**Question**:

1. What does the increase of the value of the estimated average global CH₄ sink mean (in relation to the increase of the value of average estimated CH₄ emissions)?
